First paragraph

 Currently reads: 
 "However, the local address (the server socket) is given as 1574 (or you may see mvel-lm as a service name), but the port chosen in the example is 9734. Why are they different? The answer is that port numbers and addresses are communicated over socket interfaces as binary numbers. Different computers use different byte ordering for integers. For example, an Intel processor stores the 32-bit integer as four consecutive bytes in memory in the order 1-2-3-4, where 1 is the most significant byte. IBM PowerPC processors would store the integer in the byte order 4-3-2-1. If the memory used for integers were simply copied byte-by-byte, the two different computers would not be able to agree on integer values."
